      <h1>Me, as an explanation (T_T)</h1>
      <p>My name is Francis Santonia. I am a Game Developer and a ("pending")graduate of DLSU - BS-IET-GD. I am currently trying to explore ways to appreciate and understand the innerworkings of video games while honing skills. I really like how games can be used as a medium to tell stories and put people through difficult challenges.</p>
      <p>I like watching movies/anime, baking, cycling, reading web comics/manga, and playing guitar. I am avid indie games player, that loves roguelikes and unique experiences that push the boundaries of game design.</p>
      <p>I currently do not know what carrier path should I take as I am very naive due to the numerous roles that can be taken, howver I am more siding with the programing and the technical side rather than the creative side.</p>

      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>Programming Languages: C#, C++, JavaScript, Python</p>
      <p>Game Engines: Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot</p>
      <p>Libraries & Frameworks: React, Phaser, OpenGL, DirectX11</p>
      <p>Tools: Git, Blender(only for adjusting/no full experience)</p>
